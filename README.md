# Overview of the Analysis
For this project we partnered with Jennifer, an account manager at BigMarket. SellBy, our client, loves to talk about the power of big data, but Jennifer isn't a data expert. So we started off the project by giving her a quick overview of what big data actuallyas indicated below:Jennifer during the module 16, it was learned what constitutes big data and how it's handled. it was covered Hadoop and its ecosystem. MapReduce and how it has improved the process for handling big data. and also PySpark, which has become the leading technology for handling big data.
After diving into some of the technologies used with big data, It was used and studied  at natural language processing (NLP) in relation to big data. with an introduction to cloud services. Cloud services allow store large amounts of data at remote locations rather than locally, on top of many other services. This allows for more scalability and performance. and it was used extensively the most popular cloud service available: Amazon Web Services (AWS). All of this will help us to develop well this challenge with the following deliverables:

* Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
* Deliverable 2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews
* Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis README.md
